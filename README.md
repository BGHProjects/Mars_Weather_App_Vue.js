Mars_Weather_App_Vue.js
A Mars Weather SPA made with Vue.js and the NASA API (https://api.nasa.gov/)

Displays the week's Mars weather details, as recorded from the Mars Insight Lander. Details include the current sol (day of the Martian year), maximum atmospheric temperature, minimum atmospheric temperature, average windspeed and average atmospheric pressure for the day.

Sometimes not all of these details are able to be recorded for the current day or week, and these fields are denoted with N/A.

Also displays the Astronomical Picture of the Day with a button in the top left corner. Note, sometimes this is a video and cannot be loaded in the SPA.
